# To-Do

## Optimization and Organization

Since having many files leads the browser to make more HTTP requests which results in a slower website, compile all the files with webpack into one file to attach to HTML

Also, seperate the CSS files for their respective purposes then combine into main.css file. But, this is also making more HTTP requests so switch to SCSS.

## Functionality

Perhaps a scientific mode

The more options chevron stopped animating 

## Themes

Make it easier to collaborate for others, perhaps by seperating the themes only into one file
